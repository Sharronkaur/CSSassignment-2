                Gon' pop like trouble <br>
                Breakin' into your heart like that (Ooh) <br>
                Cool shade stunner <br>
                Yeah, I owe it all to my mother <br>

                High like the moon, rock with me, baby <br>
                Know that I got that heat <br>
                Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap <br>
